### Build Sprint 7
In this sprint we spent the time learning React and trying to implement it to our app. We have been struggling because we realized it is difficult adding React to an existing ruby on rails app.

#### Do you see any impediment that prevents you or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan?

We are still struggling with React and it seems to not like Ruby on Rails. We plan on switching to another style framework if react still does not work by the middle of the week. We will most likely switch to using primarily bootstrap and css.
