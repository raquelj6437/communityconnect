### Sprint Planning
Community Connect has a long way to go so for this sprint we decided to work on the timesheet with as little design as possible to ensure that the functionality is stable.

![Student User Story](../updateImg/student_user_story.png)

Since our current focus for the sprint is mainly functionality, Sissi would continue working on the design aspect. To efficiently work through the week. We divided our work by the front and back end. Moonis and Adriana will work on the front end while Amir and Raquel work on the back end.

Most of the code for this weeks sprint will consist of HTML and SQL (as the database for the timesheet).

### Daily Scrum - February 27th
#### What did you do in the last 24 hours that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

*Raquel* - In the last 24 hours, during our team meeting, we discussed what we liked and disliked about our current wireframes and made improvements to them. Furthermore, I started learning SQL on code academy to familiarize myself with the syntax to prepare for the build sprint next week. My main assignment for this week was to create the github repository for my team and creating the README.

*Amir* - In the last 24 hours I studied up on SQL to help construct an efficient database for the project.

*Sissi* - In the last 24 hours I worked on the wireframe and made changes.

*Adriana* - In the last 24 hours, I looked over HTML/CSS to begin the rough draft code of the timesheet, focusinng mostly on functionality instead of presentation. I also made a rough idea of how the wireframes should be presented to get a better sense what should be the "main idea."

*Moonis* - In the last 24 hours, ive started working on the HTMTL code. I took notes on the wireframe.

#### What will you do in the next 24 hours to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?

*Raquel* - In the next 24 hours, I will prepare my team for the build sprint by indicating specifics that need to by done each day. I will also continue learning SQL to ensure that I am fully prepared for the build sprint.

*Amir* - In the next 24 hours I will continue to learn SQL as well as Ruby as a framework.

*Sissi* - In the next 24 hours I will continue to work on the wireframe and maybe start to think about the logo.

*Adriana* - I will continue to look over HTML/CSS and begin the front-end, to hopefully have something acceptable and functional to present on Tuesday to the team.

*Moonis* - In the next 24 hours, I shall continue working on my code and make changes as i see fit.
