### Build Sprint 2
We successfully deployed our app [here](https://community-connect-1.herokuapp.com) without bugs! That was very excting to fix because now our users can use the app without having it run locally.

This week we worked on adding buttons and a list of community service opportunities in Boston.

We met with our mentors for some advice on how we should proceed with week three build sprint. Unfortunately we forgot to take a screenshot of us on zoom but heres a screenshot.

#### Do you see any impediment that prevents you or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal? What are the impediments? What is your impediment removal plan?

One problem that might persist is creating an individual timesheet for each user and not share one database like it does now.
